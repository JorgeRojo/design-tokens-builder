## Gemini Added Memories

## Code Style Guidelines

Gemini should adhere to the code style guidelines defined in `docs/CODE_STYLE.md`.

### Avoid Excessive Code Comments

Prioritize self-descriptive function, variable, and component names over comments. Comments should be used sparingly, only to explain *why* something is done, not *what* is done.

## Language Preference

All documentation and comments generated by Gemini should be in English.
