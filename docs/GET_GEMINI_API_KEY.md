# Guide: How to Get a Google Gemini API Key

To use the AI functionality of this application, you need an API Key from the **Google AI** service. The free tier is very generous and is more than sufficient for the development and use of this tool.

Follow these steps to get your key:

## Step 1: Access Google AI Studio

1. Open your browser and go to the official **Google AI Studio** page:

   > [**https://aistudio.google.com/apikey**](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

2. Sign in with your Google account. If you don't have one, you will need to create one.

## Step 2: Create a New API Key

1. Once inside Google AI Studio, find and click on the **"Get API key"** button. It is usually located in the left-hand menu or at the top.

2. The "API keys" page will open. Click on the **"Create API key in new project"** button.

3. Google will automatically generate a new key for you. It will appear in a dialog box on your screen.

## Step 3: Copy and Save Your Key

1. Your API key is a long string of letters and numbers. **Copy it immediately** using the copy button next to it.

   > **⚠️ Important!** Treat this key like a password. Do not share it publicly or commit it to code repositories.

## Step 4: Configure the Key in the Application

1. Once you have your API key, you will be prompted to enter it directly within the application's settings or a dedicated input field. Paste your copied key into the designated area.

2. Save the key within the application, and you're all set! The application will now be able to use your key to connect to the Google Gemini API.

If you ever lose your key or believe it has been compromised, you can return to Google AI Studio, delete the old key, and create a new one by following the same steps.
