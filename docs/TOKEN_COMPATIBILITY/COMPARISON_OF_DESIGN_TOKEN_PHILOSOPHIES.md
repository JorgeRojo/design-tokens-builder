# Comparison of Design Token Philosophies

This document compares the approaches to design systems from four industry leaders: Brad Frost, Nathan Curtis, Ra√∫l Mar√≠n, and Dan Mall. Each brings a unique and valuable perspective to the field.

| **Core Philosophy**   | Tokens are the **subatomic particles** of Atomic Design.      | Tokens are an **architecture of decisions**.                      | Tokens are a **single source of truth** that must be managed efficiently. | A design system is a **product that serves other products**.                 |
| **Emphasis**          | Methodology, flexibility, and **theming**.                    | System, rigor, and **predictability**.                            | Workflow, tools, and **synchronization**.                                 | Strategy, **process**, and **collaboration**.                                |
| **Naming Convention** | Focuses on the 3-tiered structure (Global, Alias, Component). | Focuses on a predictable formula (e.g., CTI: Category/Type/Item). | Focuses on **how to implement** the structure with tools.                 | Focuses on establishing a **collaborative process to decide** on the naming. |
| **End Result**        | Flexible components that can be easily themed.                | A shared language and a solid contract between design and code.   | An **operational and synchronized** system.                               | A system that is successfully **adopted by the organization**.               |

## Analogy: Building a House

To better understand their roles:

- **Brad Frost** is the **Architect** who designs the flexible, themeable house based on a sound methodology.
- **Nathan Curtis** is the **Structural Engineer** who calculates and precisely names every single beam, screw, and material needed.
- **Ra√∫l Mar√≠n** is the **Expert Master Builder** who knows exactly which tools (like Tokens Studio) and techniques to use on-site (in Figma) to build that house quickly and robustly.
- **Dan Mall** is the **Project Manager / General Contractor** who ensures everyone works together, the client is happy, and the project is successfully completed on time and within budget.
