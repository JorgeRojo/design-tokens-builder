> âœ¨ Accelerate your design system workflow. An AI-powered editor that helps you build, manage, and refine your design tokens from a simple prompt.

**token-baker** is a desktop utility that serves as an intelligent editor and manager for your design tokens. It helps designers and developers create consistent, structured token files by connecting to the powerful Google Gemini API. You can load an existing `tokens.json` file, describe a new UI component, and use a conversational AI loop to generate, refine, and add the exact token names you need.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Scaffolding:** Uses the Google Gemini API to understand natural language prompts and suggest required token names.
- **Conversational Refinement Loop:** Iterate on AI suggestions with follow-up prompts until the list of tokens is perfect.
- **Full Token File Management:** Load, visualize, and edit existing `tokens.json` files in a clear tree structure. Save your changes back to the file.
- **Convention-Based:** Enforces a structured and scalable naming convention inspired by industry-leading design systems.
