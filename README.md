> âœ¨ Accelerate your design system workflow. An AI-powered editor that helps you build, manage, and refine your design tokens from a simple prompt.

**Token Baker** is a desktop utility that serves as an intelligent editor and manager for your design tokens. It helps designers and developers create consistent, structured token files by combining a file editor with an AI assistant. You can load an existing `tokens.json` file, describe a new UI component, and use a conversational AI loop to generate, refine, and add the exact token names you need.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Scaffolding:** Uses a local, on-device large language model (LLM) to understand your natural language prompts and suggest required token names for your components.
- **Conversational Refinement Loop:** Don't just accept suggestions. Iterate on them with follow-up prompts until the list of tokens is perfect.
- **Full Token File Management:** Load, visualize, and edit existing `tokens.json` files in a clear tree structure. Save your changes back to the file.
- **Convention-Based:** Enforces a structured and scalable naming convention inspired by industry-leading design systems.
- **Offline First & Private:** Works entirely on your machine. No user prompts or data are ever sent to the cloud.
